- You are not allowed to look at anyone else's solution, and you are not allowed to look at solutions from previous years.
- You may discuss the assignments with other students, but you may not look at or copy each others' code.
- The reason for this rule is that we believe you will learn the most by designing and implementing your lab solution yourself.
